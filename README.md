# Coding-Challenge-System
 
The Coding Challenge System is our big team project in Development Project I and II. It is a system we built to provide coding challenges to students and allow teachers to create, edit and delete challenges. Students can run their code against test cases made by the teachers and recieve their results.

It is written in C# and JavaScript and uses a SQL database.
